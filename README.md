# Pathfinding
Simple 2d Pathfinding Algorithm for games using grid

## Pathfinding on 2d aligned grid
This 2d Pathfinding system works on a 2d array-grid and can be up to 48x48 and more!

The size of this example is only 14x14 for experimenting. The higher the size of the grid, the higher is the performance cost. In this game example which is made in Heaps.io there can be added walls (obstacles) to re-route the path. This algorithm works for any game engine. It only has to be adapted properly!

### Smoothness
You can also try 'smoothnes' for using diagonals and reducing performance cost
